### Learnings

- understood the use of template literal for string-interpolation (convert variables and expressions into strings)
- multi line of strings can be written using template literals
- learned destructuring of array and objects
    * we can assign default value to the element/property while destructuring to avoid getting `undefined` ([a = 10, b = 5] = array, {a: name = "John", b} = object)
- learned spread and rest operators
    * javascript uses `...` for both spread and rest operators
    * spread operator expands iterable to individual elements
    * rest operator puts the values into a javascript array
- understood the use of default parameters in functions
- used enhanced object literal to create a new object with methods and properties
- understood the use of computed property names with static property names
